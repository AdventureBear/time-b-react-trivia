        <p>And now for something completely different.</p>
        <p>
          These questions are not restricted to a single topic. They are instead
          drawn from my life: things I love or that have influenced my life in
          some manner. Knowing me will assist you greatly in answering these.
          Not knowing me ... well, good luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer each of the following 20 questions by choosing the one correct
          answer. If you choose correctly, you'll learn a little about me and
          the answer.
